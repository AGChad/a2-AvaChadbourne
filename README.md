## The Worst Calculator
This project is a very simple (silly) calculator. The user inputs 2 numbers, chooses an operator, and can guess what the answer might be. A table on the right will show the correct answer and if the guess was correct. The user can modify or delete the data using buttons on the table. I used a CSS flexbox for handling positioning of the page elements.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-page App**: All forms and data are displayed on the same page. When an item is added, modified, or deleted, the table changes immediately to reflect it.
- **User Can Modify Data**: By pressing the "modify" button, the user can change number values, operators, and even what the correct answer is displayed as.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Tested with students**:
